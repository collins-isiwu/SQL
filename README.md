# SQL

While taking classes of my Structured Query Language (SQL). I undertook two problem solving tasks that involved using knowledge of SQL to solve. They are FIFTYVILLE and MOVIES.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.

## Fiftyville
Write SQL queries to solve a mystery.

A Mystery in Fiftyville
The CS50 Duck has been stolen! The town of Fiftyville has called upon you to solve the mystery of the stolen duck. Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. Your goal is to identify:

Who the thief is,
What city the thief escaped to, and
Who the thief’s accomplice is who helped them escape
All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it took place on Humphrey Street.

How will you go about solving this mystery? The Fiftyville authorities have taken some of the town’s records from around the time of the theft and prepared a SQLite database for you, fiftyville.db, which contains tables of data from around the town. You can query that table using SQL SELECT queries to access the data of interest to you. Using just the information in the database, your task is to solve the mystery.

I was made to solve this the above problem.



## Movies

Understanding
Provided to you is a file called movies.db, a SQLite database that stores data from IMDb about movies, the people who directed and starred in them, and their ratings. In a terminal window, run sqlite3 movies.db so that you can begin executing queries on the database.

First, when sqlite3 prompts you to provide a query, type .schema and press enter. This will output the CREATE TABLE statements that were used to generate each of the tables in the database. By examining those statements, you can identify the columns present in each table.

Notice that the movies table has an id column that uniquely identifies each movie, as well as columns for the title of a movie and the year in which the movie was released. The people table also has an id column, and also has columns for each person’s name and birth year.

Movie ratings, meanwhile, are stored in the ratings table. The first column in the table is movie_id: a foreign key that references the id of the movies table. The rest of the row contains data about the rating for each movie and the number of votes the movie has received on IMDb.

Finally, the stars and directors tables match people to the movies in which they acted or directed. (Only principal stars and directors are included.) Each table has just two columns: movie_id and person_id, which reference a specific movie and person, respectively.

The challenge ahead of you is to write SQL queries to answer a variety of different questions by selecting data from one or more of these tables.

SQL files named from 1.sql - 13.sql where used to solve the above problem.
